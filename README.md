template-responsive-drawer-layout [code](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit/tree/template-no-redux), [demo](https://template-no-redux-dot-pwa-starter-kit.appspot.com/)

This template is very similar to the master template, in the sense that it keeps both Redux for state management, and all of the UI elements. The main difference is that the wide screen layout displays a persistent app-drawer, inline with the content.
